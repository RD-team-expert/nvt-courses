                    PERFORMANCE RATING CALCULATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

FORMULA:
--------
Performance Score = (Completion Rate × 0.3) + (Avg Progress × 0.3) + 
                    (Attention Score × 0.3) - Suspicious Penalty

Where:
  • Completion Rate = (Completed Assignments / Total Assignments) × 100
  • Avg Progress = Average of all assignment progress percentages
  • Attention Score = Base attention + (Quiz Performance × 0.25)
  • Suspicious Penalty = (Suspicious Sessions / Total Sessions) × 10


COMPONENTS BREAKDOWN:
---------------------

1. COMPLETION RATE (30% weight)
   └─ Measures: How many assignments user completed
   └─ Range: 0-100%
   └─ Contribution: Up to 30 points

2. AVERAGE PROGRESS (30% weight)
   └─ Measures: How far user progressed on assignments
   └─ Range: 0-100%
   └─ Contribution: Up to 30 points

3. ATTENTION SCORE (30% weight)
   └─ Measures: User focus during learning sessions
   └─ Base Score: From learning session data
   └─ Quiz Boost: +25% of quiz performance added
   └─ Range: 0-100%
   └─ Contribution: Up to 30 points

4. SUSPICIOUS PENALTY (Deduction)
   └─ Measures: Unusual/suspicious behavior
   └─ Formula: (Suspicious Sessions / Total Sessions) × 10
   └─ Impact: Deducts from total score


RATING LEVELS:
---------------
Score ≥ 85  →  EXCELLENT
Score 70-84 →  GOOD
Score 60-69 →  AVERAGE
Score < 60  →  NEEDS IMPROVEMENT


EXAMPLE:
--------
User Data:
  • Completed: 8/10 assignments → Completion Rate = 80%
  • Avg Progress: 75%
  • Base Attention: 70%
  • Quiz Performance: 80% → Quiz Boost = 80 × 0.25 = 20
  • Adjusted Attention: 70 + 20 = 90%
  • Suspicious Sessions: 2/20 → Penalty = 1 point

Calculation:
  Score = (80 × 0.3) + (75 × 0.3) + (90 × 0.3) - 1
  Score = 24 + 22.5 + 27 - 1
  Score = 72.5

Result: GOOD (72.5 is in 70-84 range)


QUIZ INTEGRATION:
-----------------
Quiz Performance Score = (Completion Rate × 0.4) + (Passing Rate × 0.4) + 
                         (Avg Score × 0.2)

Includes:
  ✓ Regular Quizzes (assigned via quiz_assignments)
  ✓ Module Quizzes (part of course modules)

Impact on Performance:
  • 25% of quiz score is added to attention score
  • Strong quiz performance can boost overall rating
  • Example: 100% quiz score → +25 points to attention


KEY INSIGHTS:
-------------
✓ Quiz performance directly impacts overall rating through attention boost
✓ Completion and progress are equally important (30% each)
✓ Attention/focus is critical (30%)
✓ Suspicious behavior is penalized
✓ All factors combined give holistic view of user performance
