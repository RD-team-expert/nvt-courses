Project Name: **Attendance & Course Management System for NVT Courses**

### Project Overview:
Develop an attendance and course management system for NVT courses. This system will feature user authentication, a clock-in/out mechanism with ratings and comments, user self-assignment to courses, course management with user-admin interactions, email notifications, analytics, and CSV reporting. Both admin and user interfaces will be responsive and optimized for mobile screens.

### User Roles:
- **Admin:** Manage courses, users, clocking records, course registrations, ratings, and feedback.
- **User:** Clock in/out, view and self-register to available courses, and track personal progress.

### Features:

#### Authentication System:
- Secure login/logout with user credentials.
- Role management (Admin, User).

### Course Management:
- Admin creates courses with:
  - Course Name
  - Description (with HTML Pro Free Editor)
  - Start Date
  - End Date
  - Status (Pending, In Progress, Completed)
  - Level (Optional)
  - Course Duration
- Users see available courses as announcements.
- Users can self-register to courses by clicking "Count Me In" or similar.
- Admin can view registered users per course.
- Admin and users can update course statuses (Pending, In Progress, Completed).
- Once a course is marked as completed by a user, the admin can provide a rating (1-5) and comments as feedback.
- Enable notification reminders for users before course start dates.

### Clocking System:
- Users clock in/out manually (no real-time tracking).
- Users add ratings (1-5) and comments when clocking out.
- Admin can manage and view all user clock-in/out records.

### Admin Interface:
- Dashboard analytics with visual data representation.
- Tables displaying detailed course registrations, user activities, clocking records.
- Provide summary views for user and course analytics for quick assessment.
- CSV export functionality for generating Excel-compatible reports.
- CRUD operations for users:
  - Create/Edit/Delete user profiles.
  - Assign user roles.
- Manage and monitor course assignments, user feedback, and progress.

### End-User Interface:
- Responsive design optimized for mobile devices.
- View courses as announcements.

- Track personal course progress and feedback.

### Reporting & Analytics:
- Generate and export detailed CSV reports for:
  - Course registrations
  - Attendance records (Clock-in/out)
  - Course completion and feedback
- Dashboard analytics for quick insights into user engagement, attendance rates, and course effectiveness.

### Technology Stack:
- Laravel 12 Vue Starter Kit (backend & frontend)
- MySQL (database, no real-time tracking)
- Tailwind CSS (responsive UI)
- HTML Pro Free Editor (course description editing)
- Laravel Excel (CSV reporting)
- SMTP-based email notifications
